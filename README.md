# Join Tables

## Objectives

1. Learn to distinguish between the different types of relationships between data in your database: the "belongs to"/"has many" and "many-to-many" relationships. 
2. Understand how to build each type of relationship via either the use of foreign keys or the use of a join table. 
3. Understand what a join table is and how it functions. 
4. Build a join table and query data from it. 

## Data Relations

As programmers, we understand the data we are manipulating to be real. In other words, we write programs to solve real-world problems or handle real-world situations. Whether you're developing a web application that helps doctors and hospitals around the country manage patient information or coding a command line game, the code we write is modeled on real situations and things. This is true of our databases and tables as well as code we write in Ruby, Objective C, you name it. 

We use databases to store information that represents real-world entities. We might have an employee database in which an individual row in an Employees table represents one real, individual employee. Such a database might also have a Managers table that is related to the employees table. Real-world objects and environments are relational. Employees belong to managers, pets belong to owners, a person has many friends. Our relational databases have the ability to reflect that related-ness.

In relational databases, we can actually categorize the type of relationship that exists between the data that we are storing. There are two basic types of relationship that we need to concern ourselves with right now: The "has many"/"belongs to" relationship and the "many-to-many" relationship. Let's take a closer look. 

## The "has many"/"belongs to" Relationship

Let's imagine a database that keeps track of pets and their owners. This Pet's Database has an Owners table and a Cats table. The Cats table has a column, `owner_id`, that contains a foreign key corresponding to the `id` column of the Owners table. 

In this way, an individual cat is associated to the person that owns it. Any number of cats can have the same owner. In other words, any number of cats can have the same `owner_id`.

Let's say we have the following owners:

```
id               name      
---------------  ----------
1                mugumogu  
2                Sophie    
3                Penny   
``` 

And the following cats:

```
id               name        age         owner_id    breed        
---------------  ----------  ----------  ----------  -------------
1                Maru        3           1           Scottish Fold
2                Hana        1           1           Tabby        
3                Nona        4           2           Tortoiseshell
4                Lil' Bub    2                       perma-kitten 
```

Note that both Maru and Hana have the same value in the `owner_id` column, a value of `1`. This corresponds to the owner from the Owners table who has an `id` of `1`. Both Maru and Hana, therefore, have the same owner: mugumogu. If we run a query to select all of the cats whose `owner_id` is `1`, we'll return both Maru and Hana. 

The following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 1;
```

returns: 

```
id               name        age         owner_id    breed        
---------------  ----------  ----------  ----------  -------------
1                Maru        3           1           Scottish Fold
2                Hana        1           1           Tabby        
```

Our first owner, mugumogu, *has many* cats. Both Hana and Maru *belong to* mugumogu. This is the "has many"/"belongs to" relationship. 

### Enacting The Relationship Through Foreign Keys

The "has many"/"belongs to" relationship is created through the use of foreign keys. The Cats table has an `owner_id` column which is the foreign key column. It contains information that corresponds to the `id` column of the Owners table. 

The table that contains the foreign key column is the table that contains the entities that "belong to" another entity. The table that is referenced via the foreign key is the parent or owner entity that "has many" of something else. This relationship works because multiple entities in the "belonging" or child table can have the same foreign key. 

What happens, though, when a cat realizes it can live the good life by hanging out with the family across the street for extra food and care? Such a cat would have *more than one owner*. Our "has many"/"belongs to" relationship is no longer adequate. 

How might we account for a cat with many owners? Well, we could continue to add additional `owner_id` columns to the cats table. For example we could add an `owner_id_1`, `owner_id_2`, `owner_id_3` column and so on. This is not practical however. It requires us to change our schema by continuing to add columns every time a cat gains a new owner. This means our Cats table could grow to contain a possibly infinite number of columns (some cats are very popular, after all). 

We can avoid this undesirable horizontal table growth with the use of a join table. 

## Join Tables and the "many-to-many" Relationship

A **join table** contains common fields from two or more other tables. In this way, it creates a many-to-many relationship between data. Let's take a closer look at this concept by building our own join table in the following code-along. 

### Code Along I: Building a Join Table

We want to create a many-to-many association between cats and owners, such that a cat can have many owners and an owner can have many cats. Our join table will therefore have two columns, one for each of the tables we want to relate. We will have a `cat_id` column and an `owner_id` column. 

Let's set up our database to get started:

### Setting Up the Database

Create the Pet's Database in SQLite browser as `pets_database.db`


Create the following two tables:

**Cats Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT,
age INTEGER,
breed TEXT
);
```

**Owners Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE owners (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
```

Insert the following data:

**Insert Data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("mugumogu");
INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("Sophie");
INSERT INTO owners (name) VALUES ("Penny");
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES ("Maru", 3, "Scottish Fold");
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES ("Hana", 3, "Tabby");
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES ("Nona", 4, "Tortoiseshell" );
INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES ("Lil' Bub", 2, "perma-kitten");
```

### The `cats_owners` Join Table

#### Creating the Table

Now we're ready to create our join table. Since our table is creating a many-to-many relationship between cats and owners, we will call our table `cats_owners`. It is conventional to name your join tables using the names of the tables you are creating the many-to-many relationship between. 

Inside the SQLite browser's "Execute SQL" tab, execute the following SQL statement to create our join table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats_owners (
cat_id INTEGER,
owner_id INTEGER
);
```

Great! Now we're ready to start inserting some rows into our join table. 

#### Inserting Data into the Join Table

Each row in our join table will represent one cat/owner relationship. Let's say, for example, that Nona the cat has acquired a second owner, Penny. Now we want to represent that Nona has two owners, Sophie and Penny.

First, we'll insert the Nona/Sophie relationship into our join table. Recall that Nona the cat has an `id` of `3` and Sophie the owner has an `id` of `2`.

```sql
INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (3, 2);
```

Now let's check the contents of our `cats_owners` table with a SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats_owners;
```

This should return:

```
cat_id           owner_id  
---------------  ----------
3                2  
```

Now let's insert the Nona/Penny relationship into our join table:

```sql
INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (3, 3);
```

We'll confirm this insertion with another SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats_owners;
```

This should return:

```
cat_id           owner_id  
---------------  ----------
3                2         
3                3    
```

Now our table reflects that Nona, the cat with an `id` of `3`, has many (in this case two) owners. 

The great thing about our join table, however, is that it allows for the many-to-many relationship. We have a cat with many owners, now let's insert a row that will give a particular owner many cats. 

Sophie's dream has come true and now she is a co-owner of Maru the cat. Let's insert the appropriate row into our join table. Remember that Sophie has an `id` of `2` and Maru has an `id` of `1`. Let's insert that row:

```sql
INSERT INTO cats_owners (cat_id, owner_id) VALUES (1, 2);
```

Let's run a SELECT statement to confirm that our insertion worked:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cats_owners;
```

This should return:

```
cat_id           owner_id  
---------------  ----------
3                2         
3                3         
1                2    
```

Nona, our cat with an `id` of `3` has many owners and Sophie, our owner with an `id` of `2`, has many cats. Our many-to-many relationship is up and running. 

Now let's take advantage of this association by running some queries that utilize our join table to return information about these complex relationships. 

### Code Along II: Querying the Join Table

#### Basic Queries

Let's SELECT from our join table all of the owners who are associated to cat number 3. 

```sql
 SELECT cats_owners.owner_id 
 FROM cats_owners 
 WHERE cat_id = 3;
```

This should return:

```
owner_id       
---------------
2              
3       
```

Now let's SELECT all of the cats who are associated with owner number 2:

```sql
SELECT cats_owners.cat_id 
FROM cats_owners 
WHERE owner_id = 2;
```

That should return:

```
cat_id         
---------------
3              
1   
``` 

These queries are great, but it would be even better if we could write queries that would return us some further information about the cats and owners we are returning here, such as their names. Otherwise it becomes a little difficult to constantly remember cats and owners by ID only. We can do so by querying our join tables using JOIN statements. 

#### Advanced Queries 

Execute the following query:

```sql
SELECT owners.name 
FROM owners 
INNER JOIN cats_owners 
ON owners.id = cats_owners.owner_id WHERE cats_owners.cat_id = 3;
```

This should return:

```
name           
---------------
Sophie         
Penny  
```

Let's break down the above query:

* `SELECT owners.name` - Here, we declare the column data that we want to actually have returned to us. 
* `FROM owners` - Here, we specify the table whose column we are querying. 
* `INNER JOIN cats_owners ON owners.id = cats_owners.owner_id` - Here, we are joining the `cats_owners` table on the `owners` table. We are telling our query to look for owners whose `id` column matches up to the `owner_id` column in the `cats_owners` table. 
* `WHERE cats_owners.cat_id = 3;` - Here, we are adding an additional condition to our query. We are telling our query to look at the `cats_owners` table rows where the value of the `cat_id` column is `3`. Then, *for those rows only*, cross reference the `owner_id` column value with the `id` column in the `owners` table. 

Let's take a look at a boiler-plate query that utilizes a JOIN statement to query a join table:

```sql
SELECT column(s)
FROM table_one
INNER JOIN table_two
ON table_one.column_name = table_two.column_name
WHERE table_two.column_name = condition;
```

Giving this one more try, let's query the join table for the names of all of the cats owned by Sophie:

```sql
SELECT cats.name
FROM cats
INNER JOIN cats_owners
ON cats.id = cats_owners.cat_id
WHERE cats_owners.owner_id = 2;
```

This should return:

```
name           
---------------
Nona           
Maru 
```
